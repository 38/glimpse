The Glimpse Type System

The type system of Glimpse is a highly flexible framework. 
==============================================================================
First of all, there are few concept about the type system.
1) type gourp
	A type group is a set of type which are related. For example, `Integer'
	is a type group, there are serval actual type in the group, such as
	a signed 32 bit integer represented in decimal, a large integer
	represented in binary, etc. 
2) type properites
	Type properites are the properties used for describing which type is
	actually mentioned within a type group. For example, in the type group
	`integer', we have properties, length, signed/unsigned, dec/hex/oct/bin.
	In the type group of `date', the properties might be the format of the
	date(yymmdd,mm-dd-yyyy, etc).
3) type flags
	Type type flags are additional properites that are common in all types.
	There are four type flag, Vector, SubLog, Exptrapulate and Map. All type
	flags are handlered by the framework, they are decorators for original
	types.
	Vector: indicates that it will be a vector of the type given in
			the log.
	SubLog: indicates there are key value structures. If the flag is set, the
			type group and type proprieties will no longer meaningful.
	Extrapulate: indicates the value will be extrapulated from other fields,
				 this flag will prevent parse action for the field.
	Map: indicates the type is a virtual value that maps the value of other
		 points.
4) type descriptor
	Type descriptor describes which group the type belongs, the flags and the
	properties of the type
==============================================================================
The build block of the type system are type plugins which uses the
TypeDescAPI.  Type plugin might register a type group, define a parser
generator, which according to the preporties of the type. 
The plugin should implment the parser of specified type.

The registered type group are stored in a type gourp list, and each time we
can pass a type descriptor to a parser genrator to generate a gourp of function 
that might used for parse the the log described in the descriptor
